    \verse
    {\textsuperscript{1} The Lord's my Shepherd, I'll not want;}
    {\textsuperscript{2} He makes me down to lie}
    {In pastures green He leadeth me}
    {The quiet waters by.}
    \end
    \verse
    {\textsuperscript{3} My soul He doth restore again,}
    {And me to walk doth make}
    {Within the paths of righteousness,}
    {E'en for His own name's sake.}
    \end
    \verse
    {\textsuperscript{4} Yea, though I walk in death's dark vale,}
    {Yet will I fear none ill;}
    {For Thou art with me, and Thy rod}
    {And staff my comfort still.}
    \end
    \verse
    {\textsuperscript{5} My table Thou hast furnished me}
    {In presence of my foes;}
    {My head Thou dost with oil anoint,}
    {And my cup overflows.}
    \end
    \verse
    {\textsuperscript{6} Goodness and mercy all my life}
    {Shall surely follow me;}
    {And in God's house for evermore,}
    {My dwelling place shall be.}
    \end
\end{psalm}
