  \verse
    {In the darkness we were waiting}
    {Without hope without light}
    {Till from heaven You came running}
    {There was mercy in Your eyes}
    {To fulfil the law and prophets}
    {To a virgin came the Word}
    {From a throne of endless glory}
    {To a cradle in the dirt}

  \verse
    {To reveal the kingdom coming}
    {And to reconcile the lost}
    {To redeem the whole creation}
    {You did not despise the cross}
    {For even in Your suffering}
    {You saw to the other side}
    {Knowing this was our salvation}
    {Jesus for our sake You died}
  \endverse
  \verse
    {And the morning that You rose}
    {All of heaven held its breath}
    {Till that stone was moved for good}
    {For the Lamb had conquered death}
    {And the dead rose from their tombs}
    {And the angels stood in awe}
    {For the souls of all whod come}
    {To the Father are restored}
  \endverse
  \verse
    {And the Church of Christ was born}
    {Then the Spirit lit the flame}
    {Now this gospel truth of old}

    {By His blood and in His Name}
    {In His freedom I am free}
    {For the love of Jesus Christ}
    {Who has resurrected me}

  \verse
    {\textsuperscript{1} Praise God, my soul! With all my heart}
    {Let me exalt his holy name.}
    {\textsuperscript{2} Forget not all his benefits;}
    {His praise, my soul, in song proclaim.}
    {\textsuperscript{3} The {\LORD} forgives you all your sins,}
    {And heals your sickness and distress;}
    {\textsuperscript{4} Your life he rescues from the grave,}
    {And crowns you in his tenderness.}
  \endverse
  \verse
    {\textsuperscript{5} He satisfies your deep desires}
    {From his unending stores of good,}
    {So that, just like the eagle's strength,}
    {Your youthful vigour is renewed.}
    {\textsuperscript{6} The {\LORD} is known for righteous acts}
    {And justice to downtrodden ones.}
    {\textsuperscript{7} To Moses he made known his ways,}
    {His mighty deeds to Israel's sons.}
  \endverse
  \verse
    {\textsuperscript{8} The {\LORD} is merciful and kind,}
    {To anger slow, and full of grace.}
    {\textsuperscript{9} He will not constantly reprove,}
    {Or in his anger hide his face.}
    {\textsuperscript{10} He does not punish our misdeeds,}
    {Or give our sins their just reward.}
    {\textsuperscript{11} How great his love as high as heaven}
    {Towards all those who fear the {\LORD!}}
  \endverse
  \verse
    {\textsuperscript{12} As far as east is from the west,}
    {So far his love has borne away}
    {Our many sins and trespasses}
    {And all the guilt that on us lay.}
    {\textsuperscript{13} Just as a father loves his child,}
    {So God loves those who fear his name.}
    {\textsuperscript{14} For he remembers we are dust,}
    {And well he knows our feeble frame.}
  \endverse
  \verse
    {\textsuperscript{15} Each human life is like the grass,}
    {And like a meadow flower it grows.}
    {\textsuperscript{16} Its place will never be recalled}
    {Once over it the tempest blows.}
    {\textsuperscript{17} But everlasting is God's love}
    {For those who fear him, and their seed}
    {\textsuperscript{18} For those who keep his covenant,}
    {And carefully his precepts heed.}
  \endverse
  \verse
    {\textsuperscript{19} God's kingly rule is over all;}
    {In heaven he has set his throne.}
    {\textsuperscript{20} O you his angels, praise the {\LORD,}}
    {Strong ones by whom his will is done.}
    {\textsuperscript{21} O praise the {\LORD,} you heavenly hosts,}
    {His servants who perform his word.}
    {\textsuperscript{22} Praise God, his works throughout his realm,}
