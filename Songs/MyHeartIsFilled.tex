\begin{song}{My Heart Is Filled}
    \verse
    {My heart is filled with thankfulness}
    {To Him who bore my pain;}
    {Who plumbed the depths of my disgrace}
    {And gave me life again.}
    {Who crushed my curse of sinfulness,}
    {And clothed me with His light,}
    {And wrote His law of righteousness}
    {With power upon my heart.}
    \end
    \verse
    {My heart is filled with thankfulness}
    {To Him who walks beside;}
    {Who floods my weaknesses with strength}
    {And causes fears to fly;}
    {Whose every promise is enough}
    {For every step I take,}
    {Sustaining me with arms of love}
    {And crowning me with grace.}
    \end
    \verse
    {My heart is filled with thankfulness}
    {To Him who reigns above;}
    {Whose wisdom is my perfect peace,}
    {Whose every thought is love.}
    {For every day I have on Earth}
    {Is given by the King.}
    {So I will give my life, my all,}
    {To love and follow Him.}
    \end
\end{song}
