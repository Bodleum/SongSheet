\begin{song}{We Want To See Jesus Lifted High}
    \verse
    {We want to see Jesus lifted high}
    {A banner that flies across this land}
    {That all men might see the truth and know}
    {He is the way to Heaven}
    \end
    \chorus
    {We want to see, we want to see}
    {We want to see Jesus lifted high}
    {We want to see, we want to see}
    {We want to see Jesus lifted high}
    \end
    \verse
    {Step by step, we're moving forward}
    {Little by little, taking ground}
    {Every prayer a powerful weapon}
    {Strongholds come tumbling down}
    {And down and down and down}
    \end
\end{song}
