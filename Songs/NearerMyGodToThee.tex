\begin{song}{Nearer, My God, To Thee}
    \verse
    {Nearer, my God, To Thee, nearer to Thee!}
    {E'en though it be a cross that raiseth me}
    {Still all my song would be nearer, my God, to Thee,}
    {Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee!}
    \end
    \verse
    {Though like the wanderer, the sun gone down,}
    {Darkness be over me, my rest a stone}
    {Yet in my dreams I'd be nearer, my God, to Thee,}
    {Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee!}
    \end
    \verse
    {There let the way appear steps unto heav'n}
    {All that Thou sendest me in mercy giv'n}
    {Angels to beckon me nearer, my God, to Thee,}
    {Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee!}
    \end
    \verse
    {Then with my waking thoughts bright with Thy praise,}
    {Out of my stony griefs Bethel I'll raise}
    {So by my woes to be nearer, my God, to Thee,}
    {Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee!}
    \end
    \verse
    {Or if on joyful wing, cleaving the sky,}
    {Sun, moon, and stars forgot, upwards I fly,}
    {Still all my song shall be, nearer, my God, to Thee,}
    {Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee!}
    \end
\end{song}
