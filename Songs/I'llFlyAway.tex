\begin{song}{I'll Fly Away}
    \verse
    {Some bright morning when this life is over}
    {I'll fly away}
    {To that home on God's celestial shore}
    {I'll fly away}
    \end
    \chorus
    {I'll fly away, oh glory}
    {I'll fly away in the morning}
    {When I die hallelujah by and by}
    {I'll fly away}
    \end
    \verse
    {When the shadows of this life have gone}
    {I'll fly away}
    {Like a bird from these prison walls I'll fly}
    {I'll fly away}
    \end
    \verse
    {Oh how glad and happy when we meet}
    {I'll fly away}
    {No more cold iron shackles on my feet}
    {I'll fly away}
    \end
    \verse
    {Just a few more weary days and then}
    {I'll fly away}
    {To a land where joys will never end}
    {I'll fly away}
    \end
\end{song}
