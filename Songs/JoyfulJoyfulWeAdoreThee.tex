    \verse
    {Joyful, joyful, we adore Thee,}
    {God of glory, Lord of love;}
    {Hearts unfold like flow'rs before Thee,}
    {Op'ning to the sun above.}
    {Melt the clouds of sin and sadness;}
    {Drive the dark of doubt away;}
    {Giver of immortal gladness,}
    {Fill us with the light of day!}
    \end
    \verse
    {All Thy works with joy surround Thee,}
    {Earth and heav'n reflect Thy rays,}
    {Stars and angels sing around Thee,}
    {Centre of unbroken praise.}
    {Field and forest, vale and mountain,}
    {Flow'ry meadow, flashing sea,}
    {Singing bird and flowing fountain}
    {Call us to rejoice in Thee.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Thou art giving and forgiving,}
    {Ever blessing, ever blest,}
    {Wellspring of the joy of living,}
    {Ocean depth of happy rest!}
    {Thou our Father, Christ our Brother,}
    {All who live in love are Thine;}
    {Teach us how to love each other,}
    {Lift us to the joy divine.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Mortals, join the happy chorus,}
    {Which the morning stars began;}
    {Father love is reigning o'er us,}
    {Brother love binds man to man.}
    {Ever singing, march we onward,}
    {Victors in the midst of strife,}
    {Joyful music leads us Sunward}
    {In the triumph song of life.}
    \end
\end{song}
