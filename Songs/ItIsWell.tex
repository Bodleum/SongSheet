\begin{song}{It Is Well}
    \verse
    {When \m{B{\flat}}peace, like a \m{Gm}river, a\m{E{\flat}}tten\m{F}deth my \m{B{\flat}}way,}
    {\m{F}When \m{Gm}sorrows like \m{C}sea billows \m{F}roll;}
    {\m{F}What\m{B{\flat}}ever my \m{E{\flat}}lot, Thou hast \m{C}taught me to \m{F}say,}
    {It is \m{B{\flat}}well, it is \m{E{\flat}}well \m{F}with \m{B{\flat}}my soul.}
    \end
    \chorus
    {\m{B{\flat}}It is well (\m{B{\flat}}it is \m{F}well)}
    {\m{B{\flat}}With my soul (\m{F}with \m{F7}my \m{B{\flat}}soul)}
    {\m{B{\flat}}It is \m{E{\flat}}well, it is \m{B{\flat}}well \m{F}with \m{B{\flat}}my soul.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,}
    {Let this blest assurance control,}
    {That Christ hath regarded my helpless estate,}
    {And hath shed His own blood for my soul.}
    \end
    \verse
    {My sin -- Oh, the bliss of this glorious thought! --}
    {My sin, not in part but the whole,}
    {Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more,}
    {Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!}
    \end
    \verse
    {And Lord, haste the day when the faith shall be sight,}
    {The clouds be rolled back as a scroll;}
    {The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,}
    {Even so, it is well with my soul.}
    \end
\end{song}
