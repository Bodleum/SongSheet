\begin{song}{My Lighthouse}
    \verse
    {In my wrestling and in my doubts}
    {In my failures You won't walk put}
    {Your great love will lean me through}
    {You are the peace in my troubled sea}
    {You are the peace in my troubled sea}
    \end
    \verse
    {In the silence, You won't let go}
    {In my questions, Your truth will hold}
    {Your great love will lean me through}
    {You are the peace in my troubled sea}
    {You are the peace in my troubled sea}
    \end
    \chorus
    {My Lighthouse, my Lighthouse}
    {Shining through the darkness, I will follow You}
    {My Lighthouse, my Lighthouse}
    {I will trust the promise,}
    {You will carry me,}
    {Safe to shore, safe to shore,}
    {Safe to shore, safe to shore.}
    \end
    \verse
    {I won't fear what tomorrow brings}
    {With each morning I'll rise and sing}
    {My God's love will lead me through}
    {You are the peace in my troubled sea}
    {You are the peace in my troubled sea}
    \end
    \bridge
    {Fire before us, You're the brightest}
    {You will lead us through the storms}
    \end
\end{song}
