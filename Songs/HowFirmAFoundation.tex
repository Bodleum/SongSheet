\begin{song}{How Firm A Foundation}
    \verse
    {How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord,}
    {Is laid for your faith in His excellent word!}
    {What more can He say than to you He hath saidâ€”}
    {To you who for refuge to Jesus have fled?}
    \end
    \verse
    {Fear not, I am with thee, oh, be not dismayed,}
    {For I am thy God, and will still give thee aid;}
    {I'll strengthen thee, help thee, and cause thee to stand,}
    {Upheld by My gracious, omnipotent hand.}
    \end
    \verse
    {When through the deep waters I call thee to go,}
    {The rivers of sorrow shall not overflow;}
    {For I will be with thee thy trouble to bless,}
    {And sanctify to thee thy deepest distress.}
    \end
    \verse
    {When through fiery trials thy pathway shall lie,}
    {My grace, all-sufficient, shall be thy supply;}
    {The flame shall not harm thee; I only design}
    {Thy dross to consume and thy gold to refine.}
    \end
    \verse
    {The soul that on Jesus doth lean for repose,}
    {I will not, I will not, desert to his foes;}
    {That soul, though all hell should endeavour to shake,}
    {I'll never, no never, no never forsake.}
    \end
\end{song}
