\begin{song}{Oh Praise The Name}
    \verse
    {I cast my mind to Calvary}
    {Where Jesus bled and died for me}
    {I see His wounds, His hands, His feet}
    {My Saviour on that cursed tree}
    \end
    \verse
    {His body bound and drenched in tears}
    {They laid Him down in Joseph's tom{\flat}}
    {The entrance sealed by heavy stone}
    {Messiah still and all alone}
    \end
    \chorus
    {Oh praise the name of the Lord our God}
    {Oh praise His name for evermore}
    {For endless days we will sing Your praise}
    {O Lord, O Lord our God}
    \end
    \verse
    {And then on the third at break of dawn}
    {The Son of Heaven rose again}
    {Oh trampled death where is your sting?}
    {The angels roar for Christ the King}
    \end
    \verse
    {He shall return in robes of white}
    {The blazing sun shall pierce the night}
    {And I will rise among the saints}
    {My gaze transfixed on Jesus' face}
    \end
\end{song}
