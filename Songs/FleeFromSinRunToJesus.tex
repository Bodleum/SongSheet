\begin{song}{Flee From Sin, Run To Jesus}
    \verse
    {There is \m{Bm}grace for the \m{G}daily war with \m{D}sin\m{A}}
    {for the \m{Bm}battles that \m{G}rage within my \m{D}heart\m{A}}
    {I am \m{Bm}held in my \m{G}Father's ever\m{D}lasting \m{A}arms}
    {He's my \m{Bm}shield from the \m{G}devil's \m{D}fiery darts.}
    \end
    \verse
    {There's a refuge for every lustful thought}
    {from old habits enticing me away}
    {when I fear my addictions won't be overcome}
    {there is hope through Christ's resurrection day.}
    \end
    \chorus
    {There is \m{G}power in the finished work of \m{D}Jesus}
    {to \m{Em}change helpless sinners just like \m{Bm}me}
    {there's con\m{G}tentment where nothing else can \m{D}satis\m{G}fy}
    {so I'll \m{Bm}flee from my \m{A}sin to Christ the \m{G}Lord}
    {put my \m{Bm}faith in the \m{G}promise \m{A}of His \m{D}word.}
    \end
    \verse
    {God calls all of His children to obey,}
    {live a life of submission to His word}
    {may I learn what it means to seek His kingdom first,}
    {die to self, give my all to serve the Lord.}
    \end
    \verse
    {There's forgiveness for every time I fail}
    {as I turn in repentance from my sin}
    {God provides all the help I need to persevere}
    {Praise His name! That my life is found in Him.}
    \end
\end{song}
