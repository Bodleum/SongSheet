\begin{song}{Come, People Of The Risen King}
    \verse
    {Come, people of the risen King,}
    {Who delight to bring Him praise.}
    {Come, all and tune your hearts to sing}
    {To the Morning Star of grace.}
    {From the shifting shadows of the Earth}
    {We will lift our eyes to Him,}
    {Where steady arms of mercy reach}
    {To gather children in.}
    \end
    \chorus
    {Rejoice! Rejoice! Let every tongue rejoice!}
    {One heart, one voice, O Church of Christ, rejoice!}
    \end
    \verse
    {Come, those whose joy is morning sun}
    {And those weeping through the night.}
    {Come, those who tell of battles won,}
    {And those struggling in the fight.}
    {For His perfect love will never change,}
    {And His mercies never cease,}
    {But follow us through all our days}
    {With the certain hope of peace.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Come, young and old from every land,}
    {Men and women of the faith.}
    {Come, those with full or empty hands,}
    {Find the riches of His grace.}
    {Over all the world, His people sing,}
    {Shore to shore we hear them call}
    {The Truth that cries through every age;}
    {`Our God is all in all'.}
    \end
\end{song}
