\begin{song}{Oh The Deep, Deep Love Of Jesus}
    \verse
    {Oh the deep, deep love of Jesus,}
    {Vast unmeasured, boundless, free!}
    {Rolling as a mighty ocean in its fullness over me!}
    {Underneath me, all around me,}
    {Is the current of Thy love}
    {Leading onward, leading homeward,}
    {To Thy glorious rest above!}
    \end
    \verse
    {Oh the deep, deep love of Jesus,}
    {Spread His praise from shore to shore!}
    {How He loveth, ever loveth,}
    {Changeth never, nevermore!}
    {How He watches o'er His loved ones,}
    {Died to call them all His own}
    {How for them He intercedeth, watcheth}
    {O'er them from the throne!}
    \end
    \verse
    {Oh the deep, deep love of Jesus,}
    {Love of every love the best!}
    {‘Tis an ocean vast of blessing,}
    {‘Tis a Heaven sweet of rest!}
    {Oh the deep, deep love of Jesus,}
    {'Tis a heav'n of heav'ns to me}
    {And it lifts me up to glory, for it lifts me up to Thee!}
    \end
\end{song}
