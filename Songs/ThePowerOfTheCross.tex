\begin{song}{The Power Of The Cross}
    \verse
    {O, to see the dawn of the darkest day:}
    {Christ on the road to Calvary}
    {Tried by sinful men, torn and beaten, then}
    {Nailed to a cross of wood}
    \end
    \chorus
    {This, the pow'r of the cross:}
    {Christ became sin for us;}
    {Took the blame, bore the wrath}
    {We stand forgiven at the cross}
    \end
    \verse
    {Oh, to see the pain written on Your face}
    {Bearing the awesome weight of sin}
    {Ev'ry bitter thought ev'ry evil deed}
    {Crowning Your bloodstained brow}
    \end
    \verse
    {Now the daylight flees; now the ground beneath}
    {Quakes as its Maker bows His head}
    {Curtain torn in two, dead are raised to life;}
    {``Finished!'' the vict'ry cry}
    \end
    \verse
    {Oh, to see my name written in the wounds}
    {For through Your suffering I am free}
    {Death is crushed to death; life is mine to live}
    {Won through Your selfless love}
    \end
\end{song}
