\begin{song}{See, What A Morning}
    \verse
    {See, what a morning, gloriously bright,}
    {With the dawning of hope in Jerusalem;}
    {Folded the grave-clothes, tomb filled with light,}
    {As the angels announce, “Christ is risen!”}
    {See God's salvation plan,}
    {Wrought in love, borne in pain, paid in sacrifice,}
    {Fulfilled in Christ, the Man,}
    {For He lives: Christ is risen from the dead!}
    \end
    \verse
    {See Mary weeping, “Where is He laid?”}
    {As in sorrow she turns from the empty tomb;}
    {Hears a voice speaking, calling her name;}
    {It's the Master, the Lord raised to life again!}
    {The voice that spans the years,}
    {Speaking life, stirring hope, bringing peace to us,}
    {Will sound till He appears,}
    {For He lives: Christ is risen from the dead!}
    \end
    \verse
    {One with the Father, Ancient of Days,}
    {Through the Spirit who clothes faith with certainty.}
    {Honour and blessing, glory and praise}
    {To the King crowned with pow'r and authority!}
    {And we are raised with Him,}
    {Death is dead, love has won, Christ has conquered;}
    {And we shall reign with Him,}
    {For He lives: Christ is risen from the dead!}
    \end
\end{song}
