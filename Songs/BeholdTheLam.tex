\begin{song}{Behold The Lamb \extra{Communion Hymn}}
    \verse
    {Behold the Lamb who bears our sins away,}
    {Slain for us - and we remember}
    {The promise made that all who come in faith}
    {Find forgiveness at the cross.}
    {So we share in this bread of life,}
    {And we drink of His sacrifice}
    {As a sign of our bonds of peace}
    {Around the table of the King.}
    \end
    \verse
    {The body of our Saviour Jesus Christ,}
    {Torn for you - eat and remember}
    {The wounds that heal, the death that brings us life}
    {Paid the price to make us one.}
    {So we share in this bread of life,}
    {And we drink of His sacrifice}
    {As a sign of our bonds of love}
    {Around the table of the King.}
    \end
    \verse
    {The blood that cleanses every stain of sin,}
    {Shed for you - drink and remember}
    {He drained death's cup that all may enter in}
    {To receive the life of God.}
    {So we share in this bread of life,}
    {And we drink of His sacrifice}
    {As a sign of our bonds of grace}
    {Around the table of the King.}
    \end
    \verse
    {And so with thankfulness and faith we rise}
    {To respond, - and to remember}
    {Our call to follow in the steps of Christ}
    {As His body here on Earth.}
    {As we share in His suffering}
    {We proclaim Christ will come again!}
    {And we'll join in the feast of Heaven}
    {Around the table of the King}
    \end
\end{song}
