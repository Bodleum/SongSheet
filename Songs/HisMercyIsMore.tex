\begin{song}{His Mercy Is More}
    \verse
    {What love could remember no wrongs we have done}
    {Omniscient, all knowing, He counts not their sum}
    {Thrown into a sea without bottom or shore}
    {Our sins they are many, His mercy is more}
    \end
    \chorus
    {Praise the Lord, His mercy is more}
    {Stronger than darkness, new every morn}
    {Our sins they are many, His mercy is more}
    \end
    \verse
    {What patience would wait as we constantly roam}
    {What Father, so tender, is calling us home}
    {He welcomes the weakest, the vilest, the poor}
    {Our sins they are many, His mercy is more}
    \end
    \verse
    {What riches of kindness He lavished on us}
    {His blood was the payment, His life was the cost}
    {We stood 'neath a debt we could never afford}
    {Our sins they are many, His mercy is more}
    \end
\end{song}
