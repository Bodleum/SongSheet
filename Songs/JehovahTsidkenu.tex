\begin{song}{Jehovah Tsidkenu}
    \verse
    {I \m{D}once was a stranger to grace and to \m{G}God,}
    {I knew not my \m{D}danger, and felt not my \m{Asus}load;\mm{ }\m{A}}
    {Though friends spoke in \m{D}rapture of Christ on the \m{G}tree,}
    {Jehovah Tsid\m{D}kenu was \m{Asus}nothing to \m{D}me.\m{G}\mm{\enspace}\m{D}}
    \end
    \verse
    {I oft read with pleasure, to sooth or engage,}
    {Isaiah's wild measure and John's simple page;}
    {But e'en when they pictured the blood sprinkled tree}
    {Jehovah Tsidkenu seemed nothing to me.}
    \end
    \verse
    {When free grace awoke me, by light from on high,}
    {Then legal fears shook me, I trembled to die;}
    {No refuge, no safety in self could I see—}
    {Jehovah Tsidkenu my Saviour must be.}
    \end
    \verse
    {My terrors all vanished before the sweet name;}
    {My guilty fears banished, with boldness I came}
    {To drink at the fountain, life giving and free—}
    {Jehovah Tsidkenu is all things to me.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Even treading the valley, the shadow of death,}
    {This watchword shall rally my faltering breath;}
    {For while from life's fever my God sets me free,}
    {Jehovah Tsidkenu, my death song shall be.}
    \end
\end{song}
