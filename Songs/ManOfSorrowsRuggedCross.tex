\begin{song}{Man Of Sorrows \extra{Rugged Cross}}
    \verse
    {Man of sorrows Lamb of God}
    {By His own betrayed}
    {The sin of man and wrath of God}
    {Has been on Jesus laid}
    \end
    \verse
    {Silent as He stood accused}
    {Beaten mocked and scorned}
    {Bowing to the Father's will}
    {He took a crown of thorns}
    \end
    \chorus
    {Oh that rugged cross}
    {My salvation}
    {Where Your love poured out over me}
    {Now my soul cries out}
    {Hallelujah}
    {Praise and honour unto Thee}
    \end
    \verse
    {Sent of Heaven God's own Son}
    {To purchase and redeem}
    {And reconcile the very ones}
    {Who nailed Him to that tree}
    \end
    \bridge
    {Now my debt is paid, it is paid in full}
    {By the precious blood, that my Jesus spilled}
    {Now the curse of sin, has no hold on me}
    {Whom the Son sets free, O is free indeed}
    \end
    \verse
    {See the stone is rolled away}
    {Behold the empty tom{\flat}}
    {Hallelujah God be praised}
    {He's risen from the grave}
    \end
\end{song}
