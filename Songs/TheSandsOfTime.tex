\begin{song}{The Sands Of Time}
    \verse
    {The sands of time are sinking}
    {The dawn of Heaven breaks}
    {The summer morn I've sighed for}
    {The fair sweet morn awakes}
    {Dark, dark hath been the midnight}
    {But day spring is at hand}
    {And glory, glory dwelleth}
    {In Emmanuel's land.}
    \end
    \verse
    {The King there is His beauty,}
    {Without a veil is seen:}
    {It were a well spent journey,}
    {Though seven deaths lay between:}
    {The Lamb with His fair army}
    {Doth on Mount Zion stand,}
    {And glory, glory dwelleth}
    {In Emmanuel's land.}
    \end
    \verse
    {O Christ, He is the fountain,}
    {The deep sweet well of love!}
    {The streams on Earth I've tasted}
    {More deep I'll drink above:}
    {There to an ocean fullness}
    {His mercy doth expand,}
    {And glory, glory dwelleth}
    {In Emmanuel's land.}
    \end
\end{song}
