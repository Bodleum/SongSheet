\begin{song}{Tell Out, My Soul}
    \verse
    {Tell out, my soul, the greatness of the Lord!}
    {Unnumbered blessings give my spirit voice;}
    {Tender to me the promise of his word;}
    {In God my Saviour shall my heart rejoice}
    \end
    \verse
    {Tell out, my soul, the greatness of his Name!}
    {Make known his might, the deeds his arm has done;}
    {His mercy sure, from age to age to same;}
    {His holy Name, the Lord, the Mighty One}
    \end
    \verse
    {Tell out, my soul, the greatness of his might!}
    {Powers and dominions lay their glory by}
    {Proud hearts and stubborn wills are put to flight}
    {The hungry fed, the humble lifted high}
    \end
    \verse
    {Tell out, my soul, the glories of his word!}
    {Firm is his promise, and his mercy sure}
    {Tell out, my soul, the greatness of the Lord}
    {To children's children and for evermore!}
    \end
\end{song}
