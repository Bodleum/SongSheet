\begin{song}{From The Depths Of Woe}
    \verse
    {From the depths of woe I raise to Thee}
    {The voice of lamentation;}
    {Lord, turn a gracious ear to me}
    {And hear my supplication;}
    {If Thou iniquities dost mark,}
    {Our secret sins and misdeeds dark,}
    {O who shall stand before Thee?}
    \end
    \verse
    {To wash away the crimson stain,}
    {Grace, grace alone availeth;}
    {Our works, alas are all in vain;}
    {In much the best life faileth:}
    {No man can glory in Thy sight,}
    {All must alike confess Thy might,}
    {And live alone by mercy.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Therefore my trust is in the Lord,}
    {And not in mine own merit;}
    {On Him my soul shall rest, His word}
    {Upholds my fainting spirit:}
    {His promised mercy is my fort,}
    {My comfort and my sweet support;}
    {I wait for Him with patience.}
    \end
    \verse
    {What though I wait the livelong night,}
    {And till the dawn appeareth,}
    {My heart still trusteth in His might;}
    {It doubteth not nor feareth:}
    {Do thus, O ye of Israel's seed,}
    {Ye of the Spirit born indeed;}
    {And wait till God appeareth.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Though great our sins and sore our woes,}
    {His grace much more aboundeth;}
    {His helping love no limit knows}
    {Our utmost need it soundeth.}
    {Our Shepherd good and true is He,}
    {Who will at last His Israel free}
    {From all their sin and sorrow.}
    \end
\end{song}
