    {Blessed be Your name}
    {In the land that is plentiful}
    {Where Your streams of abundance flow}
    {Blessed be Your name}
    \end
    \verse
    {Blessed be Your name}
    {When I'm found in the desert place}
    {Though I walk through the wilderness}
    {Blessed Be Your name}
    \end
    \chorus
    {Every blessing You pour out}
    {I'll turn back to praise}
    {When the darkness closes in, Lord}
    {Still I will say}
    \end

    {Blessed be Your name}
    {On the road marked with suffering}
    {Though there's pain in the offering}
    {Blessed be Your name}
    \end

    {You give and take away}
    {You give and take away}
    {My heart will choose to say}
    {Lord, blessed be Your name}
    \end
