\begin{song}{Dear Refuge Of My Weary Soul}
    \verse
    {Dear Refuge of my weary soul,}
    {On Thee, when sorrows rise}
    {On Thee, when waves of trouble roll,}
    {My fainting hope relies}
    {To Thee I tell each rising grief,}
    {For Thou alone canst heal}
    {Thy Word can bring a sweet relief,}
    {For every pain I feel}
    \end
    \verse
    {But oh! When gloomy doubts prevail,}
    {I fear to call Thee mine}
    {The springs of comfort seem to fail,}
    {And all my hopes decline}
    {Yet gracious God, where shall I flee?}
    {Thou art my only trust}
    {And still my soul would cleave to Thee}
    {Though prostrate in the dust}
    \end
    \verse
    {Hast Thou not bid me seek Thy face,}
    {And shall I seek in vain?}
    {And can the ear of sovereign grace,}
    {Be deaf when I complain?}
    {No still the ear of sovereign grace,}
    {Attends the mourner's prayer}
    {Oh may I ever find access,}
    {To breathe my sorrows there}
    \end
    \verse
    {Thy mercy seat is open still,}
    {Here let my soul retreat}
    {With humble hope attend Thy will,}
    {And wait beneath Thy feet,}
    {Thy mercy seat is open still,}
    {Here let my soul retreat}
    {With humble hope attend Thy will,}
    {And wait beneath Thy feet}
    \end
\end{song}
