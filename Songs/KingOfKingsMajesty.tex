\begin{song}{King Of Kings, Majesty}
    \verse
    {King of kings, majesty,}
    {God of Heaven living in me,}
    {Gentle Saviour, closest friend,}
    {Strong deliverer, beginning and end,}
    {All within me falls at Your throne.}
    \end
    \chorus
    {Your majesty, I can but bow,}
    {I lay my all before You now.}
    {In royal robes I don't deserve}
    {I live to serve Your majesty.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Earth and Heaven worship You,}
    {Love eternal, faithful and true,}
    {Who bought the nations, ransomed souls,}
    {Brought this sinner near to Your throne;}
    {All within me cries out in praise.}
    \end
\end{song}
