\begin{song}{I Will Sing The Wondrous Story}
    \verse
    {I will sing the wondrous story}
    {Of the Christ Who died for me;}
    {How He left His home in glory}
    {For the cross of Calvary.}
    \end
    \chorus
    {Yes, I'll sing the wondrous story}
    {Of the Christ Who died for me,}
    {Sing it with the saints in glory,}
    {For the Cross of Calvary.}
    \end
    \verse
    {I was lost, but Jesus found me,}
    {Found the sheep that went astray,}
    {Threw His loving arms around me,}
    {Drew me back into His way.}
    \end
    \verse
    {I was bruised, but Jesus healed me,}
    {Faint was I from many a fall,}
    {Sight was gone, and fears possessed me,}
    {But He freed me from them all.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Days of darkness still come o'er me,}
    {Sorrow's path I often tread,}
    {But His presence still is with me;}
    {By His guiding hand I'm led.}
    \end
    \verse
    {He will keep me till the river}
    {Rolls its waters at my feet;}
    {Then He'll bear me safely over,}
    {Where the loved ones I shall meet.}
    \end
\end{song}
