\begin{song}{Here Is Love, Vast As The Ocean}
    \verse
    {Here is love, vast as the ocean,}
    {loving-kindness as the flood,}
    {when the Prince of Life, our Ransom,}
    {shed for us His precious blood.}
    {Who His love will not remember?}
    {Who can cease to sing His praise?}
    {He can never be forgotten}
    {throughout heav'n's eternal days.}
    \end
    \verse
    {On the mount of crucifixion}
    {fountains opened deep and wide;}
    {through the floodgates of God's mercy}
    {flowed a vast and gracious tide.}
    {Grace and love, like mighty rivers,}
    {poured incessant from above,}
    {and heav'n's peace and perfect justice}
    {kissed a guilty world in love.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Let me all Thy love accepting,}
    {Love Thee, ever all my days;}
    {Let me seek Thy kingdom only}
    {And my life be to Thy praise;}
    {Thou alone shalt be my glory,}
    {Nothing in the world I see.}
    {Thou hast cleansed and sanctified me,}
    {Thou Thyself hast set me free.}
    \end
    \verse
    {In Thy truth Thou dost direct me}
    {By Thy Spirit through Thy Word;}
    {And Thy grace my need is meeting}
    {as I trust in Thee, my Lord.}
    {Of Thy fullness Thou art pouring}
    {Thy great love and pow'r on me,}
    {Without measure, full and boundless,}
    {Drawing out my heart to Thee.}
    \end
\end{song}
