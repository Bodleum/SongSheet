\begin{song}{Lord From Sorrows Deep I Call}
    \verse
    {Lord, from sorrows deep I call}
    {When my hope is shaken}
    {Torn and ruined from the fall}
    {Hear my desperation}
    \end
    \verse
    {For so long I've pled and prayed}
    {God, come to my rescue}
    {Even so the thorn remains}
    {Still my heart will praise You}
    \end
    \verse
    {Storms within my troubled soul}
    {Questions without answers}
    {On my faith these billows roll}
    {God, be now my shelter}
    \end
    \verse
    {Why are you cast down, my soul?}
    {Hope in Him who saves you}
    {When the fires have all grown cold}
    {Cause this heart to praise You (oh, my soul)}
    \end
    \chorus
    {And oh, my soul, put your hope in God}
    {My help, my rock, I will praise Him}
    {Sing, oh, sing through the raging storm}
    {You're still my God, my salvation}
    \end
    \verse
    {Should my life be torn from me}
    {Every worldly pleasure}
    {When all I possess is grief}
    {God, be then my treasure}
    \end
    \verse
    {Be my vision in the night}
    {Be my hope and refuge}
    {'Til my faith is turned to sight}
    {Lord, my heart will praise You}
    \end
    \chorus
    {And oh, my soul, put your hope in God}
    {My help, my rock, I will praise Him}
    {Sing, oh, sing through the raging storm}
    {You're still my God, my salvation}
    \end
\end{song}
