%    \verse
%        {This world can be cold and bitter}
%        {Feels like we're in the dead of winter}
%        {Waiting on something better}
%        {But am I really gonna hide forever?}
%    \end
%    \verse
%        {Over and over again}
%        {I hear Your voice in my head}
%        {Let Your light shine, let Your light shine for all to see}
%    \end
%    \chorus
%        {Start a fire in my soul}
%        {Fan the flame and make it grow}
%        {So there's no doubt or denying}
%        {Let it burn so brightly}
%        {That everyone around can see}
%        {That it's You, that it's You that we need}
%        {Start a fire in me}
%    \end
%    \verse
%        {You only need a spark to start a whole blaze}
%        {It only takes a little faith}
%        {Let it start right here in this city}
%        {So these old walls will never be the same}
%    \end
%    \verse
%        {Over and over again}
%        {I hear Your voice in my head}
%        {They need to know}
%        {I need to go}
%        {Spirit won't You fall on my heart now}
%    \end
%    \bridge
%        {You are the fire You are the flame}
%        {You are the light on the darkest day}
%        {We have the hope we bear Your name}
%        {We carry the news that You have come to save}
%        {Only You can save}
%    \end
