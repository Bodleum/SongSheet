\begin{song}{On Jordan's Stormy Banks}
    \verse
    {On Jordan's stormy banks I stand,}
    {And cast a wishful eye}
    {To Canaan's fair and happy land,}
    {Where my possessions lie.}
    \end
    \chorus
    {I am bound for the promised land,}
    {I am bound for the promised land;}
    {Oh, who will come and go with me?}
    {I am bound for the promised land.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Oh, the transporting, rapturous scene}
    {That rises to my sight!}
    {Sweet fields arrayed in living green,}
    {And rivers of delight!}
    \end
    \verse
    {O'er all those wide, extended plains}
    {Shines one eternal day;}
    {There God the Son forever reigns,}
    {And scatters night away.}
    \end
    \verse
    {No chilling winds or poisonous breath}
    {Can reach that healthful shore;}
    {Sickness and sorrow, pain and death,}
    {Are felt and feared no more.}
    \end
    \verse
    {When I shall reach that happy place,}
    {I'll be forever blest,}
    {For I shall see my Father's face,}
    {And in His bosom rest.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Filled with delight my raptured soul}
    {Would here no longer stay;}
    {Though Jordan's waves around me roll,}
    {Fearless, I'd launch away.}
    \end
\end{song}
