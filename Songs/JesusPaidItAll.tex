\begin{song}{Jesus Paid It All}
    \verse
    {I hear the Saviour say}
    {Thy strength indeed is small}
    {Child of weakness, watch and pray}
    {Find in me thine all in all}
    \end
    \chorus
    {Jesus paid it all}
    {All to Him I owe}
    {Sin had left a crimson stain}
    {He washed it white as snow}
    \end
    \verse
    {Lord, now indeed I find}
    {Thy power and thine alone}
    {Can change the leper's spots}
    {And melt the heart of stone}
    \end
    \verse
    {And when before the throne}
    {I stand in Him complete}
    {Jesus died my soul to save}
    {My lips shall still repeat}
    \end
\end{song}
