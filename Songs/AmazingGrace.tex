\begin{song}{Amazing Grace}
    \verse
    {Amazing grace! How sweet the sound}
    {That saved a wretch like me!}
    {I once was lost but now am found;}
    {Was blind but now I see.}
    \end
    \verse
    {‘Twas grace that taught this heart to fear,}
    {And grace my fears relieved;}
    {How precious did that grace appear}
    {The hour I first believed.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Through many dangers toils and snares,}
    {I have already come;}
    {‘Tis grace that brought me safe thus far,}
    {And grace will lead me home.}
    \end
    \verse
    {The Lord has promised good to me,}
    {His Word my hope secures;}
    {He will my Shield and Portion be,}
    {As long as life endures.}
    \end
    \verse
    {When we've been there ten thousand years,}
    {Bright shining as the Sun;}
    {We've no less days to sing God's praise,}
    {Than when we've first begun.}
    \end
\end{song}
