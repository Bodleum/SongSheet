\begin{song}{See The Conqueror}
    \verse
    {See the Conqueror mounts in triumph}
    {See the King in royal state}
    {Riding on the clouds His chariot}
    {To his Heavenly palace gate}
    {Hark the choirs of angel voices}
    {Joyful alleluias sing}
    {And the portals high are lifted}
    {to receive their Heavenly King.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Who is this that comes in glory}
    {with the trump of jubilee?}
    {Lord of battles, God of armies,}
    {He has gained the victory!}
    {He who on the cross did suffer!}
    {He who from the grave arose!}
    {He has vanquished sin and Satan!}
    {He by death has spoiled his foes!}
    \end
    \bridge
    {They raced to the tomb, angels stood by}
    {Mary was weeping for the empty inside}
    {For the sins of the world, for the sake of His bride}
    {He went to His death, and behold, He's alive!}
    {He's alive! O, He's alive!}
    \end
    \verse
    {Thou hast raised our human nature}
    {In the clouds to God's right hand}
    {There we sit in Heavenly places}
    {There with Thee in glory stand}
    {Jesus reigns adorned by angels}
    {Man with God is on the throne}
    {Mighty Lord in Thine ascension}
    {We by faith behold our own}
    {We by faith behold our own}
    \end
\end{song}
