\begin{song}{Across The Lands}
    \verse
    {You're the \m{C}Word of \m{G}God the \m{F}Father,}
    {From be\m{C}fore the \m{G}world began;}
    {Every \m{F}star and every \m{C}planet}
    {Has been \m{Dm}fashioned by Your \m{F}hand.}
    {All cre\m{C}ation \m{G}holds to\m{F}gether}
    {By the \m{C}power \m{G}of Your voice}
    {Let the \m{F}skies declare Your \m{C}glory}
    {Let the \m{Dm}land and \m{F}seas re\m{G}joice!}
    \end
    \chorus
    {You're the \m{F}Author of cre\m{C}ation,}
    {You're the \m{F}Lord of \m{G}every \m{Am}man;}
    {And Your \m{F}cry of love rings \m{Am}out}
    {A\m{G}cross the \m{C}lands.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Yet You left the gaze of angels,}
    {Came to seek and save the lost,}
    {And exchanged the joy of Heaven}
    {For the anguish of a cross.}
    {With a prayer you fed the hungry,}
    {With a word You stilled the sea.}
    {Yet how silently You suffered}
    {That the guilty may go free.}
    \end
    \verse
    {With a shout You rose victorious,}
    {Wrestling victory from the grave,}
    {And ascended into Heaven}
    {Leading captives in Your wake.}
    {Now You stand before the Father}
    {Interceding for Your own;}
    {From each tribe and tongue and nation,}
    {You are leading sinners home!}
    \end
\end{song}
