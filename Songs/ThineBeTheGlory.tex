\begin{song}{Thine Be The Glory}
    \verse
    {Thine be the glory, risen, conqu'ring Son;}
    {Endless is the victory, Thou o'er death hast won;}
    {Angels in bright raiment rolled the stone away,}
    {Kept the folded grave clothes where Thy body lay.}
    {Thine be the glory, risen conquering Son,}
    {Endless is the vict'ry, Thou o'er death hast won.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Lo! Jesus meets us, risen from the tomb;}
    {Lovingly He greets us, scatters fear and gloom;}
    {Let the church with gladness, hymns of triumph sing;}
    {For her Lord now liveth, death hath lost its sting.}
    {Thine be the glory, risen conquering Son,}
    {Endless is the vict'ry, Thou o'er death hast won.}
    \end
    \verse
    {No more we doubt Thee, glorious Prince of life;}
    {Life is naught without Thee; aid us in our strife;}
    {Make us more than conqu'rors,}
    {Through Thy deathless love:}
    {Bring us safe through Jordan to Thy home above.}
    {Thine be the glory, risen conquering Son,}
    {Endless is the vict'ry, Thou o'er death hast won.}
    \end
\end{song}
