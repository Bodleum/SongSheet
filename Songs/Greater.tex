\begin{song}{Greater}
    \verse
    {Bring your tired and bring your shame}
    {Bring your guilt and bring your pain}
    {Don't you know that's not your name}
    {You will always be much more to me}
    {And everyday I wrestle with the voices}
    {That keep telling me I'm not right}
    {But that's alright}
    \end
    \chorus
    {`Cause I hear a voice and He calls me redeemed}
    {When others say I'll never be enough}
    {And greater is the One living inside of me}
    {Than he who is living in the world}
    {In the world}
    {In the world}
    {And greater is the One living inside of me}
    {Than he who is living in the world}
    \end
    \verse
    {Bring your doubts and bring your fears}
    {Bring your hurt and bring your tears}
    {There'll be no condemnation here}
    {You are holy, righteous and redeemed}
    {And every time I fall there'll be those}
    {Who will call me ``a mistake''}
    {Well that's OK}
    \end
    \bridge
    {There'll be days I lose the battle}
    {Grace says that it doesn't matter}
    {'Cause the cross already won the war}
    {He's greater}
    {He's greater}
    {I am learning to run freely}
    {Understanding just how He sees me}
    {And it makes me love Him more and more}
    {He's greater}
    {He's greater}
    \end
\end{song}
