\begin{song}{Praise, My Soul, The King Of Heaven}
    \verse
    {Praise, my soul, the King of Heaven;}
    {To His feet thy tribute bring.}
    {Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven,}
    {Evermore His praises sing:}
    {Praise Him, praise Him, alleluia!}
    {Praise the everlasting King.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Praise Him for His grace and favour}
    {To our fathers in distress;}
    {Praise Him still the same as ever,}
    {Slow to chide, and swift to bless.}
    {Praise Him, praise Him, alleluia!}
    {Glorious in His faithfulness.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Father like He tends and spares us,}
    {Well our feeble frame He knows;}
    {In His hands He gently bears us,}
    {Rescues us from all our foes.}
    {Praise Him, praise Him, alleluia!}
    {Widely yet His mercy flows.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Frail as summer's flow'r we flourish,}
    {Blows the wind and it is gone;}
    {But while mortals rise and perish,}
    {Our God lives unchanging on.}
    {Praise Him, praise Him, alleluia!}
    {Praise the high Eternal One!}
    \end
    \verse
    {Angels, help us to adore Him,}
    {Ye behold Him face to face;}
    {Sun and moon, bow down before Him;}
    {Dwellers all in time and space,}
    {Praise Him, praise Him, alleluia!}
    {Praise with us the God of grace.}
    \end
\end{song}
