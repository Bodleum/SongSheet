\begin{song}{Christ Is Risen, He Is Risen Indeed}
    \verse
    {How can it be, the One who died,}
    {Has borne our sin through sacrifice}
    {To conquer every sting of death?}
    {Sing, sing hallelujah.}
    \end
    \verse
    {For joy awakes as dawning light}
    {When Christ's disciples lift their eyes.}
    {Alive He stands, their Friend and King;}
    {Christ, Christ He is risen.}
    \end
    \chorus
    {Christ is risen, He is risen indeed!}
    {Oh, sing hallelujah.}
    {Join the chorus, sing with the redeemed;}
    {Christ is risen, He is risen indeed.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Where doubt and darkness once had been,}
    {They saw Him and their hearts believed.}
    {But blessed are those who have not seen,}
    {Yet, sing hallelujah.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Once bound by fear now bold in faith,}
    {They preached the truth and power of grace.}
    {And pouring out their lives they gained}
    {Life, life everlasting.}
    \end
    \verse
    {The power that raised Him from the grave}
    {Now works in us to powerfully save.}
    {He frees our hearts to live His grace;}
    {Go tell of His goodness.}
    \end
    \bridge
    {He's alive, He's alive!}
    {Heaven's gates are opened wide.}
    {He's alive, He's alive!}
    {Now in Heaven glorified.}
    \end
\end{song}
