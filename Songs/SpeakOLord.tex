\begin{song}{Speak O Lord}
    \verse
    {Speak, O Lord, as we come to You}
    {To receive the food of your holy word.}
    {Take Your truth, plant it deep in us;}
    {Shape and fashion us in Your likeness,}
    {That the light of Christ might be seen today}
    {In our acts of love and our deeds of faith.}
    {Speak, O Lord, and fulfil in us}
    {All Your purposes, for Your glory.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Teach us Lord full obedience,}
    {Holy reverence, true humility.}
    {Test our thoughts and our attitudes}
    {In the radiance of Your purity.}
    {Cause our faith to rise}
    {Cause our eyes to see,}
    {Your majestic love and authority.}
    {Words of power that can never fail;}
    {Let their truth prevail over unbelief.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Speak, O Lord, and renew our minds;}
    {Help us grasp the heights of Your plans for us.}
    {Truths unchanged from the dawn of time,}
    {That will echo down through eternity.}
    {And by grace we'll stand on Your promises;}
    {And by faith we'll walk as You walk with us.}
    {Speak, O Lord, `til your church is built}
    {And the Earth is filled with Your glory.}
    \end
\end{song}
