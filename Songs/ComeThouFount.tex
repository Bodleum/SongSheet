\begin{song}{Come, Thou Fount}
    \verse
    {Come, Thou \m{G}fount of every \m{D}blessing,}
    {Tune my \m{C}heart to \m{D}sing Thy \m{G}grace;}
    {\m{G}Streams of mercy, never \m{D}ceasing,}
    {Call for \m{C}songs of \m{D}loudest \m{G}praise.}
    {\m{G}Teach me \m{Em}some melodious \m{G}sonnet,}
    {Sung by \m{Em}flaming tongues \m{G}above.}
    {Praise the \m{G}mount! I'm fixed \m{D}upon it,}
    {\m{D}Mount of \m{C}Thy re\m{D}deeming \m{G}love.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Here I raise mine Ebenezer;}
    {Hither by Thy help I'm come;}
    {And I hope, by Thy good pleasure,}
    {Safely to arrive at home.}
    {Jesus sought me when a stranger,}
    {Wandering from the fold of God;}
    {He, to rescue me from danger,}
    {Interposed His precious blood.}
    \end
    \verse
    {O to grace how great a debtor}
    {Daily I'm constrained to be!}
    {Let Thy goodness, like a fetter,}
    {Bind my wandering heart to Thee.}
    {Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,}
    {Prone to leave the God I love;}
    {Here's my heart, O take and seal it,}
    {Seal it for Thy courts above.}
    \end
\end{song}
