\begin{song}{We Will Feast}
    \chorus
    {\m{E}We will \m{C\sharp m}feast in the \m{A}house of \m{E}Zion}
    {\m{C\sharp m}We \m{B}will \m{A}sing with our \m{F\sharp m}hearts re\m{B}stored}
    {He has \m{E}done great \m{C\sharp m}things, we will \m{A}say to\m{E}gether\m{B}}
    {\m{C\sharp m}We \m{A}will feast and \m{E}weep \m{B}no \m{E}more}
    \end
    \verse
    {We will not be \m{A}burned by the \m{C\sharp m}fire}
    {He \m{A}is the \m{B}Lord our \m{C\sharp m}God}
    {We are not con\m{A}sumed, by the \m{C\sharp m}flood}
    {Up\m{A}held, pro\m{B}tected, \m{C\sharp m}gathered \m{B}up}
    \end
    \verse
    {In the dark of night, before the dawn}
    {My soul, be not afraid}
    {For the promised morning, oh how long?}
    {Oh God of Jacob, be my strength}
    \end
    \verse
    {Every vow we've broken and betrayed}
    {You are the Faithful one}
    {And from the garden to the grave}
    {Bind us together, bring shalom.}
    \end
\end{song}
