\begin{song}{We Will Feast}
    \chorus
    {We will feast in the house of Zion}
    {We will sing with our hearts restored}
    {He has done great things, we will say together}
    {We will feast and weep no more}
    \end
    \verse
    {We will not be burned by the fire}
    {He is the LORD our God}
    {We are not consumed, by the flood}
    {Upheld, protected, gathered up}
    \end
    \verse
    {In the dark of night, before the dawn}
    {My soul, be not afraid}
    {For the promised morning, oh how long?}
    {Oh God of Jacob, be my strength}
    \end
    \verse
    {Every vow we've broken and betrayed}
    {You are the Faithful one}
    {And from the garden to the grave}
    {Bind us together, bring shalom.}
    \end
\end{song}
