\begin{song}{All Glory Be To Christ}
    \verse
    {Should \m{G}nothing of our \m{D}efforts stand}
    {No \m{Em}legacy sur\m{C}vive}
    {Un\m{G}less the Lord does \m{D}raise the house}
    {In \m{Em}vain its \m{C}builders \m{G}strive}
    {To you who boast tomorrow's gain}
    {Tell me, What is your life?}
    {A mist that vanishes at dawn}
    {All glory be to Christ!}
    \end
    \chorus
    {All \m{G}glory be to \m{D}Christ our king!}
    {All \m{G}glory be to \m{C}Christ!}
    {His \m{G}rule and reign we'll \m{D}ever sing}
    {All \m{Em}glory \m{C}be to \m{G}Christ!}
    \end
    \verse
    {His will be done, His kingdom come}
    {On Earth as is above}
    {Who is Himself our daily bread}
    {Praise Him, the Lord of love}
    {Let living water satisfy}
    {The thirsty without price}
    {We'll take a cup of kindness yet}
    {All glory be to Christ!}
    \end
    \verse
    {When on the day the great I Am}
    {The faithful and the true}
    {The Lamb who was for sinners slain}
    {Is making all things new}
    {Behold our God shall live with us}
    {And be our steadfast light}
    {And we shall e'er his people be}
    {All glory be to Christ!}
    \end
\end{song}
