\begin{song}{I Asked The Lord}
    \verse
    {I asked the Lord that I might grow}
    {In faith and love and ev'ry grace}
    {Might more of His salvation know}
    {And seek more earnestly His face}
    \end
    \verse
    {`Twas He who taught me thus to pray}
    {And He I trust has answered prayer}
    {But it has been in such a way}
    {As almost drove me to despair}
    \end
    \verse
    {I hoped that in some favoured hour}
    {At once He'd answer my request}
    {And by His love's constraining power}
    {Subdue my sins and give me rest}
    \end
    \verse
    {Instead of this He made me feel}
    {The hidden evils of the heart}
    {And let the angry powers of hell}
    {Assault my soul in ev'ry part}
    \end
    \verse
    {Yea more with His own hand He seemed}
    {Intent to aggravate my woe}
    {Crossed all the fair designs I'd schemed}
    {Blasted my gourds and laid me low}
    \end
    \verse
    {Lord why is this I trembling cried}
    {Wilt Thou pursue Thy worm to death}
    {'Tis in this way the Lord replied}
    {I answer prayer for grace and faith}
    \end
    \verse
    {These inward trials I employ}
    {From self and pride to set thee free}
    {And break thy schemes of Earthly joy}
    {That thou may'st seek Thy all in me}
    \end
\end{song}
