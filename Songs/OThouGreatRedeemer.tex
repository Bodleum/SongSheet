\begin{song}{O Thou Great Redeemer}
    \verse
    {Guide me O thou great Redeemer}
    {Pilgrim through this barren land.}
    {I am weak but Thou art mighty}
    {Hold me with thy powerful hand.}
    {Bread of Heaven, bread of Heaven}
    {Feed me now and evermore,}
    {Feed me now and evermore.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Open now the crystal fountain}
    {Whence the healing streams do flow,}
    {Let the fiery cloudy pillar}
    {Lead me all my journey though,}
    {Strong Deliverer, strong Deliverer}
    {Be Thou still my strength and shield,}
    {Be Thou still my strength and shield.}
    \end
    \verse
    {When I tread the verge of Jordan}
    {Bid my anxious fears subside}
    {Death of death, and hell's destruction,}
    {Land me safe on Canaan's side,}
    {Songs of praises, songs of praises}
    {I will ever give to thee,}
    {I will ever give to thee.}
    \end
\end{song}
