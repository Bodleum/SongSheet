    \verse
    {Lord the light of Your love is shining }
    {In the midst of the darkness, shining}
    {Jesus, Light of the world, shine upon us}
    {Set us free by the truth You now bring us}
    {Shine on me, shine on me}
    \end
    \chorus
    {Shine, Jesus, shine }
    {Fill this land with the Father's glory}
    {Blaze, Spirit, blaze, Set our hearts on fire}
    {Flow, river, flow}
    {Flood the nations with grace and mercy}
    {Send forth Your Word, Lord And let there be light}
    \end
    \verse
    {Lord, I come into Your awesome presence}
    {From the shadows into Your radiance}
    {By the blood I may enter Your brightness}
    {Search me, try me, consume all my darkness}
    {Shine on me, shine on me}
    \end
    \verse
    {As we gaze on Your kindly brightness.}
    {So our faces display Your likeness.}
    {Ever changing from glory to glory,}
    {Mirrored here may our lives tell Your story.}
    {Shine on me, shine on me.}
    \end
