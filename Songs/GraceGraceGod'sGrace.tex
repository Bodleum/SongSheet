\begin{song}{Grace, Grace, God's Grace}
    \verse
    {Marvellous grace of our loving Lord,}
    {Grace that exceeds our sin and our guilt!}
    {Yonder on Calvary's mount out poured,}
    {There where the blood of the Lamb was spilled.}
    \end
    \chorus
    {Grace, grace, God's grace,}
    {Grace that will pardon and cleanse within;}
    {Grace, grace, God's grace,}
    {Grace that is greater than all our sin!}
    \end
    \verse
    {Sin and despair, like the sea waves cold,}
    {Threaten the soul with infinite loss;}
    {Grace that is greater, yes, grace untold,}
    {Points to the refuge, the mighty cross.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Dark is the stain that we cannot hide;}
    {What can we do to wash it away?}
    {Look! There is flowing a crimson tide,}
    {Brighter than snow you may be today.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Marvellous, infinite, matchless grace,}
    {Freely bestowed on all who believe!}
    {You that are longing to see His face,}
    {Will you this moment His grace receive?}
    \end
\end{song}
