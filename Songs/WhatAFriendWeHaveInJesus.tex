\begin{song}{What A Friend We Have In Jesus}
    \verse
    {What a friend we have in Jesus,}
    {All our sins and griefs to bear!}
    {What a privilege to carry}
    {Everything to God in prayer!}
    {O, what peace we often forfeit,}
    {O, what needless pain we bear,}
    {All because we did not carry}
    {Everything to God in prayer!}
    \end
    \verse
    {Have we trials and temptations?}
    {Is there trouble anywhere?}
    {We should never be discouraged-}
    {Take it to the Lord in prayer.}
    {Can we find a friend so faithful,}
    {Who will all our sorrows share?}
    {Jesus knows our every weakness;}
    {Take it to the Lord in prayer.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Are we weak and heavy laden,}
    {Cumbered with a load of care?}
    {Precious Saviour, still our refuge-}
    {Take it to the Lord in prayer.}
    {Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?}
    {Take it to the Lord in prayer!}
    {in His arms He'll take and shield thee,}
    {Thou wilt find a solace there.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Blessed Saviour, Thou hast promised}
    {Thou wilt all our burdens bear;}
    {May we ever, Lord, be bringing}
    {All to Thee in earnest prayer.}
    {Soon in glory bright, unclouded,}
    {There will be no need for prayer-}
    {Rapture, praise and endless worship}
    {Will be our sweet portion there.}
    \end
\end{song}
