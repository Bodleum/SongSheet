\begin{song}{Rock Of Ages}
    \verse
    {Rock of ages, cleft for me,}
    {Let me hide myself in Thee;}
    {Let the water and the blood,}
    {From Thy riven side which flowed,}
    {Be of sin the double cure,}
    {Save me from its guilt and power.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Not the labour of my hands}
    {Can fulfil Thy law's demands;}
    {Could my zeal no respite know,}
    {Could my tears forever flow,}
    {All could never sin erase,}
    {Thou must save, and save by grace.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Nothing in my hands I bring,}
    {Simply to Thy cross I cling;}
    {Naked, come to Thee for dress,}
    {Helpless, look to Thee for grace:}
    {Foul, I to the fountain fly,}
    {Wash me, Saviour, or I die.}
    \end
    \verse
    {While I draw this fleeting breath,}
    {When mine eyes shall close in death,}
    {When I soar to worlds unknown,}
    {See Thee on Thy judgement throne,}
    {Rock of Ages, cleft for me,}
    {Let me hide myself in Thee.}
    \end
\end{song}
