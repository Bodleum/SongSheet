\begin{song}{Light Of The World}
    \verse
    {Light of the world, You stepped down into darkness}
    {Opened my eyes, let me see}
    {Beauty that made this heart adore You}
    {Hope of a life spent with You}
    \end
    \chorus
    {Here I am to bow down}
    {Here I am to say that You're my God}
    {You're altogether lovely}
    {Altogether worthy}
    {Altogether wonderful to me}
    \end
    \verse
    {King of all days, O so highly exalted,}
    {Glorious in Heaven above}
    {Humbly You came to the Earth You created}
    {All for love's sake became poor}
    \end
    \bridge
    {I'll never know how much it cost}
    {To see my sin upon that cross}
    \end
\end{song}
