\begin{song}{Your Royal Blood}
    \verse
    {What can wash away my sin?}
    {What can make me whole again?}
    {What can make me white as snow?}
    {Nothing but Your royal blood}
    \end
    \verse
    {What can heal the heart of stone?}
    {What can resurrect these bones?}
    {There's no other fount I know}
    {Nothing but Your royal blood}
    \end
    \chorus
    {Your blood will never lose its power}
    {Your blood will never lose}
    {Your victory will stand forever}
    {Your blood will never lose}
    \end
    \bridge
    {This was won upon the cross}
    {This was written on his scars}
    {This has made us conquerors}
    {Nothing but Your royal blood}
    {Nothing but Your royal blood}
    \end
    \verse
    {Now by this we'll overcome}
    {Now by this we'll reach our home}
    {Now our sin and shame are gone}
    {Only by Your royal blood}
    \end
\end{song}
