    \verse
    {Brother, sister let me serve you.}
    {Let me be as Christ to you}
    {Pray that I might have the grace}
    {To let you be my servant too}
    \end
    \verse
    {We are pilgrims on the journey}
    {We are travellers on the road}
    {We are here to help each other}
    {Walk the mile and bear the load}
    \end
    \verse
    {I will hold the Christ light for you}
    {In the night time of your fear}
    {I will hold my hand out to you}
    {Speak the peace you long to hear.}
    \end
    \verse
    {I will weep when you are weeping}
    {When you laugh, I'll laugh with you}
    {I will share your joy and sorrow}
    {Till we've seen this journey through}
    \end
    \verse
    {When we sing to God in Heaven,}
    {We shall find such harmony}
    {Born of all we've known together}
    {Of Christ's love and agony.}
    \end
