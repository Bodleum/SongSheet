\begin{song}{Amazing Grace \extra{My Chains Are Gone}}
    \verse
    {Amazing grace, how sweet the sound}
    {That saved a wretch like me}
    {I once was lost, but now I'm found}
    {Was blind, but now I see}
    \end
    \verse
    {`Twas grace that taught my heart to fear}
    {And grace my fears relieved}
    {How precious did that grace appear}
    {The hour I first believed}
    \end
    \chorus
    {My chains are gone}
    {I've been set free}
    {My God, my Saviour has ransomed me}
    {And like a flood His mercy reigns}
    {Unending love, amazing grace}
    \end
    \verse
    {The Lord has promised good to me}
    {His word my hope secures}
    {He will my shield and portion be}
    {As long as life endures.}
    \end
    \verse
    {The Earth shall soon dissolve like snow}
    {The sun forbear to shine}
    {But God, Who called me here below,}
    {Will be forever mine.}
    \end
\end{song}
