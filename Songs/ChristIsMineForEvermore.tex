\begin{song}{Christ Is Mine For Evermore}
    \verse
    {Mine are days that God has numbered}
    {I was made to walk with Him}
    {Yet I look for worldly treasure}
    {And forsake the King of kings}
    {But mine is hope in my Redeemer}
    {Though I fall, his love is sure}
    {For Christ has paid for every failing}
    {I am His for evermore}
    \end
    \verse
    {Mine are tears in times of sorrow}
    {Darkness not yet understood}
    {Through the valley I must travel}
    {Where I see no earthly good}
    {But mine is peace that flows from heaven}
    {And the strength in times of need}
    {I know my pain will not be wasted}
    {Christ completes his work in me}
    \end
    \verse
    {Mine are days here as a stranger}
    {Pilgrim on a narrow way}
    {One with Christ I will encounter}
    {Harm and hatred for his name}
    {But mine is armour for this battle}
    {Strong enough to last the war}
    {And he has said he will deliver}
    {Safely to the golden shore}
    \end
    \bridge
    {Come rejoice now, O my soul}
    {For His love is my reward}
    {Fear is gone and hope is sure.}
    {Christ is mine for evermore}
    \end
    \verse
    {And mine are keys to Zion city}
    {Where beside the King I walk}
    {For there my heart has found its treasure}
    {Christ is mine for evermore}
    \end
\end{song}
