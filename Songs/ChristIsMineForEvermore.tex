\begin{song}{Christ Is Mine For Evermore}
    \verse
    {Mine are \m{B{\flat}}days that \m{E{\flat}}God has \m{B{\flat}}numbered}
    {I was \m{Gm}made to \m{F}walk with \m{B{\flat}}Him}
    {Yet I look for \m{E{\flat}}worldly \m{B{\flat}}treasure}
    {And for\m{Gm}sake the \m{F}King of \m{B{\flat}}kings}
    {But \m{B{\flat}}mine is \m{E{\flat}}hope in my Re\m{B{\flat}}deemer}
    {Though I \m{F}fall, his love is \m{B{\flat}}sure}
    {For \m{B{\flat}}Christ has \m{E{\flat}}paid for every \m{B{\flat}}failing}
    {I am \m{F}His for ever\m{B{\flat}}more}
    \end
    \verse
    {Mine are tears in times of sorrow}
    {Darkness not yet understood}
    {Through the valley I must travel}
    {Where I see no earthly good}
    {But mine is peace that flows from heaven}
    {And the strength in times of need}
    {I know my pain will not be wasted}
    {Christ completes his work in me}
    \end
    \verse
    {Mine are days here as a stranger}
    {Pilgrim on a narrow way}
    {One with Christ I will encounter}
    {Harm and hatred for his name}
    {But mine is armour for this battle}
    {Strong enough to last the war}
    {And he has said he will deliver}
    {Safely to the golden shore}
    \end
    \bridge
    {Come rejoice now, O my soul}
    {For His love is my reward}
    {Fear is gone and hope is sure.}
    {Christ is mine for evermore}
    \end
    \verse
    {And mine are keys to Zion city}
    {Where beside the King I walk}
    {For there my heart has found its treasure}
    {Christ is mine for evermore}
    \end
