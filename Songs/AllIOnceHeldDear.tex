\begin{song}{All I Once Held Dear \extra{Knowing You}}
    \verse
    {All I once held dear, built my life upon}
    {All this world reveres, and wars to own}
    {All I once thought gain I have counted loss}
    {Spent and worthless now, compared to this}
    \end
    \chorus
    {Knowing you, Jesus, knowing you,}
    {There is no greater thing}
    {You're my all, you're my best}
    {You're my joy, my righteousness}
    {And I love you, Lord}
    \end
    \verse
    {Now my heart's desire is to know you more}
    {To be found in you and known as yours}
    {To possess by faith what I could not earn}
    {All-surpassing gift of righteousness}
    \end
    \verse
    {Oh, to know the power of your risen life}
    {And to know You in Your sufferings}
    {To become like you in your death, my Lord}
    {So with you to live and never die}
    \end
\end{song}
