    {All his works are righteousness}
    {Who speaks the truth deep within his heart}
    {Does not slander with his lips}
    \end
    \verse
    {He who loves all his neighbours well}
    {Does no wrong unto his friends}
    {Who honours all those who fear the Lord}

    {And who never takes a bribe}
    {He's honest in everything he does}
    {Never moves or turns aside}
