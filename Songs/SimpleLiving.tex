\begin{song}{Simple Living \extra{A Rich Young Man}}
    \verse
    {A rich young man came to ask of Christ:}
    {``Good teacher, will you tell me}
    {What must I do for eternal life?}
    {I've kept your laws completely.''}
    {``Sell all you have; give to the poor.}
    {Then Heaven's treasure shall be yours.''}
    {How hard for those who are rich on Earth}
    {To gain the wealth of Heaven.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Now Jesus sat by the offering gate}
    {As people brought their money.}
    {The rich they filled the collection plate;}
    {The widow gave a penny.}
    {“Now she's out-given all the rest;}
    {Her gift was all that she possessed.”}
    {Not what you give but what you keep}
    {Is what the King is counting.}
    \end
    \verse
    {O teach me Lord to walk this road,}
    {The road of simple living;}
    {To be content with what I own}
    {And generous in giving.}
    {And when I cling to what I have,}
    {Please wrest it quickly from my grasp.}
    {I'd rather lose all the things of Earth}
    {To gain the things of Heaven.}
    \end
\end{song}
