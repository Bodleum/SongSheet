\begin{song}{Marvellous Light}
    \verse
    {I am not who I once was}
    {Defined by all the things I've done}
    {Afraid my shame would be exposed}
    {Afraid of really being known}
    {But then you gave my heart a home}
    \end
    \chorus
    {So I walked out of the darkness and into the light}
    {From fear of shame into the hope of life}
    {Mercy called my name and made a way to fly}
    {Out of the darkness and into the light}
    \end
    \verse
    {With years of keeping secrets safe}
    {Wondering if I could change}
    {'Cause when you're hiding all alone}
    {Your heart can turn into a stone}
    {And that's not the way I want to go}
    \end
    \bridge
    {There's no place I would rather be}
    {Your light is Marvellous}
    {Your light is Marvellous}
    {You have come to set us free}
    {You are Marvellous}
    {Your light is Marvellous}
    \end
\end{song}
