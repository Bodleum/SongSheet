\begin{song}{Abide With Me}
    \verse
    {Abide with me; fast falls the eventide;}
    {The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide;}
    {When other helpers fail and comforts flee,}
    {Help of the helpless, O abide with me.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day;}
    {Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away;}
    {Change and decay in all around I see-}
    {O Thou who changest not, abide with me.}
    \end
    \verse
    {I need Thy presence every passing hour;}
    {What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's pow'r?}
    {Who, like Thyself, my guide and stay can be?}
    {Through cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide with me.}
    \end
    \verse
    {I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless;}
    {Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness;}
    {Where is death's sting? Where, grave, thy victory?}
    {I triumph still, if Thou abides with me.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Hold Thou Thy cross before my closing eyes;}
    {Shine through the gloom and point me to the skies;}
    {Heav'n's morning breaks, and Earth's vain shadows flee;}
    {In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.}
    \end
\end{song}
