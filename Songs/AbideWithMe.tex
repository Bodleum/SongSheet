    \verse
    {\m{D}Abide \m{A}with \m{D}me; fast \m{G}falls the \m{A}even\m{D}tide;}
    {\m{D}The \m{A}darkness \m{G}dee\m{D}pens; \m{Em}Lord, with \m{D}me \m{E7}a - \m{A}bide;}
    {\m{D}When o\m{A}ther \m{D}helpers \m{G}fail and \m{B7}comforts \m{Em}flee,}
    {\m{A}Help \m{D}of the \m{Bm}helpless, \m{G}O a\m{D}bide \m{A}with \m{D}me.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day;}
    {Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away;}
    {Change and decay in all around I see-}
    {O Thou who changest not, abide with me.}
    \end
    \verse
    {I need Thy presence every passing hour;}
    {What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's pow'r?}
    {Who, like Thyself, my guide and stay can be?}
    {Through cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide with me.}
    \end
    \verse
    {I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless;}
    {Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness;}
    {Where is death's sting? Where, grave, thy victory?}
    {I triumph still, if Thou abides with me.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Hold Thou Thy cross before my closing eyes;}
    {Shine through the gloom and point me to the skies;}
    {Heav'n's morning breaks, and Earth's vain shadows flee;}
    {In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.}
    \end
\end{song}
