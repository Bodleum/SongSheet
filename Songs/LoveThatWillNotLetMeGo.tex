\begin{song}{Love That Will Not Let Me Go}
    \verse
    {O love that will not let me go,}
    {I rest my weary soul in thee;}
    {I give thee back the life I owe,}
    {That in thine ocean depths its flow}
    {May richer, fuller be.}
    \end
    \verse
    {O light that foll'west all the way,}
    {I yield my flick'ring torch to thee;}
    {My heart restores its borrowed ray,}
    {That in thy sunshine's blaze its day}
    {May brighter, fairer be.}
    \end
    \verse
    {O joy that sleekest me through pain,}
    {I cannot close my heart to thee;}
    {I trace the rainbow through the rain,}
    { And feel the promise is not vain,}
    {That mourn shall tearless be.}
    \end
    \verse
    {O cross that liftest up my head,}
    {I dare not ask to fly from thee;}
    {I lay in dust life's glory dead,}
    {And from the ground there blossoms red}
    {Life that shall endless be.}
    \end
\end{song}
