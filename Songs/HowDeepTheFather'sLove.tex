\begin{song}{How Deep The Father's Love}
    \verse
    {How \m{D}deep the Father's \m{Em}love \m{D}for \m{G}us,}
    {How \m{D}vast beyond all mea\m{A}sure,}
    {That \m{D}He should give His \m{Em}on\mm{-}\m{D}ly \m{G}Son}
    {To \m{D}make a wretch His \m{A}trea\m{D}sure.}
    {How great the pain of \m{Em}sear\m{D}ing \m{G}loss --}
    {The \m{D}Father turns His \m{Bm}face a\m{A}way,}
    {As \m{D}wounds which mar the \m{Em}Cho\m{D}sen \m{G}One}
    {Bring \m{D}many sons to \m{A}glo\m{D}ry.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Behold the man upon a cross,}
    {My sin upon His shoulders;}
    {Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice}
    {Call out among the scoffers.}
    {It was my sin that held Him there}
    {Until it was accomplished;}
    {His dying breath has brought me life –}
    {I know that it is finished.}
    \end
    \verse
    {I will not boast in anything,}
    {No gifts, no power, no wisdom;}
    {But I will boast in Jesus Christ,}
    {His death and resurrection.}
    {Why should I gain from His reward?}
    {I cannot give an answer;}
    {But this I know with all my heart –}
    {His wounds have paid my ransom.}
    \end
