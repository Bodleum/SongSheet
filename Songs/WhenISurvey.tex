\begin{song}{When I Survey}
    \verse
    {When I survey the wondrous cross}
    {On which the Prince of Glory died}
    {My richest gain I count but loss}
    {And pour contempt on all my pride.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Forbid it Lord that I should boast}
    {Save in the death of Christ my God}
    {All the vain things that charm me most}
    {I sacrifice them to His blood.}
    \end
    \verse
    {See from His head, His hands, His feet}
    {Sorrow and love flow mingled down}
    {Did ere such love and sorrow meet}
    {Or thorns compose so rich a crown?}
    \end
    \verse
    {Were the whole realm of nature mine}
    {That were an offering far too small}
    {Love so amazing, so divine}
    {Demands my soul, my life my all.}
    \end
\end{song}
