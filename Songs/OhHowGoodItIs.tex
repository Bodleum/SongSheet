\begin{song}{Oh How Good It Is}
    \verse
    {Oh how good it is, when the family of God}
    {Dwells together in spirit, in faith and unity.}
    {Where the bonds of peace, of acceptance and love}
    {Are the fruit of His presence, here among us.}
    \end
    \chorus
    {So with one voice we'll sing to the Lord}
    {And with one heart we'll live out His word}
    {Till the whole Earth sees}
    {The Redeemer has come}
    {For He dwells in the presence of His people.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Oh how good it is, on this journey we share}
    {To rejoice with the happy}
    {And weep with those who mourn.}
    {For the weak find strength, the afflicted find grace}
    {When we offer the blessing, of belonging.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Oh how good it is, to embrace His command}
    {To prefer one another, forgive as He forgives.}
    {When we live as one, we all share in the love}
    {Of the Son with the Father, and the Spirit.}
    \end
\end{song}
