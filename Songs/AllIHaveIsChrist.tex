\begin{song}{All I Have Is Christ}
    \verse
    {\m{D}I once was \m{A}lost in \m{D}darkest \m{G}night}
    {Yet thought I \m{A}knew the \m{D}way}
    {The sin that \m{A}promised \m{D}joy and \m{G}life}
    {Had led me \m{A}to the \m{D}grave}
    {I had no \m{A}hope that You would \m{Bm}own}
    {A rebel \m{G}to Your \m{D}will}
    {And if You \m{Em}had not loved me \m{Bm}first}
    {I would re\m{G}fuse You \m{A}still}
    \end
    \chorus
    {Halle\m{G}lu\mm{-}\m{D}jah! All I \m{A}have is \m{Bm}Christ}
    {Halle\m{G}lu\mm{-}\m{Bm}jah! Jesus \m{A}is my \m{D}life}
    \end
    \verse
    {But as I ran my hell-bound race}
    {Indifferent to the cost}
    {You looked upon my helpless state}
    {And led me to the cross}
    {And I beheld God's love displayed}
    {You suffered in my place}
    {You bore the wrath reserved for me}
    {Now all I know is grace}
    \end
    \verse
    {Now, Lord, I would be Yours alone}
    {And live so all might see}
    {The strength to follow Your commands}
    {Could never come from me}
    {O Father, use my ransomed life}
    {In any way You choose}
    {And let my song forever be}
    {My only boast is You}
    \end
\end{song}
