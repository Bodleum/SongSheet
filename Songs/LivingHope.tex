\begin{song}{Living Hope}
    \verse
    {How great the chasm that lay between us}
    {How high the mountain I could not climb}
    {In desperation, I turned to heaven}
    {And spoke your name into the night}
    {Then through the darkness}
    {Your loving kindness}
    {Tore through the shadows of my soul}
    {The work is finished, the end is written}
    {Jesus Christ, my living hope}
    \end
    \verse
    {Who could imagine so great a mercy?}
    {What heart could fathom such boundless grace?}
    {The God of ages stepped down from glory}
    {To wear my sin and bear my shame}
    {The cross has spoken, I am forgiven}
    {The king of kings calls me His own}
    {Beautiful saviour, I'm yours forever}
    {Jesus Christ, my living hope}
    \end
    \chorus
    {Hallelujah, praise the one who set me free}
    {Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me}
    {You have broken every chain}
    {There's salvation in your name}
    {Jesus Christ, my living hope}
    \end
    \bridge
    {Then came the morning that sealed the promise}
    {Your buried body began to breathe}
    {Out of the silence, the roaring lion}
    {Declared the grave has no claim on me}
    {Jesus, yours is the victory, whoa!}
    \end
\end{song}
