\begin{song}{Be Thou My Vision}
    \verse
    {Be Thou my vision, O Lord of my heart}
    {Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art}
    {Thou my best thought by day or by night}
    {Waking or sleeping Thy presence my light.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Be Thou my wisdom and Thou my true word}
    {I ever with Thee is Thou with me, Lord}
    {Thou my great Father and I Thy true son}
    {Thou in me dwelling and I with Thee one.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Riches I heed not nor man's empty praise}
    {Thou mine inheritance, now and always}
    {Thou and Thou only the first in my heart}
    {High King of Heaven, my treasure Thou art.}
    \end
    \verse
    {High King of Heaven my victory won}
    {May I reach Heaven's joys, O bright Heaven's Sun}
    {Heart of my own heart, whatever befall}
    {Still be my vision O Ruler of all.}
    \end
\end{song}
