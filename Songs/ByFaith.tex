\begin{song}{By Faith}
    \verse
    {By faith we see the hand of God}
    {In the light of creation's grand design}
    {In the lives of those who prove His faithfulness}
    {Who walk by faith and not by sight}
    \end
    \verse
    {By faith our fathers roamed the Earth}
    {With the power of His promise in their hearts}
    {Of a holy city built by God's own hand}
    {A place where peace and justice reign}
    \end
    \chorus
    {We will stand as children of the promise}
    {We will fix our eyes on Him our soul's reward}
    {Till the race is finished and the work is done}
    {We'll walk by faith and not by sight}
    \end
    \verse
    {By faith the prophets saw a day}
    {When the longed-for Messiah would appear}
    {With the power to break the chains of sin and death}
    {And rise triumphant from the grave}
    \end
    \verse
    {By faith the church was called to go}
    {In the power of the Spirit to the lost}
    {To deliver captives and to preach good news}
    {In every corner of the Earth}
    \end
    \verse
    {By faith this mountain shall be moved}
    {And the power of the gospel shall prevail}
    {For we know in Christ all things are possible}
    {For all who call upon His name}
    \end
\end{song}
