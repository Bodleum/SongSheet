\begin{song}{Boldly I Approach Your Throne}
    \verse
    {By grace alone somehow I stand}
    {Where even angels fear to tread}
    {Invited by redeeming love}
    {Before the throne of God above}
    {He pulls me close with nail-scarred hands}
    {Into His everlasting arms}
    \end
    \verse
    {When condemnation grips my heart}
    {And Satan tempts me to despair}
    {I hear the voice that scatters fear}
    {The Great I Am the Lord is here}
    {Oh praise the One who fights for me}
    {And shields my soul eternally}
    \end
    \chorus
    {Boldly I approach Your throne}
    {Blameless now I'm running home}
    {By Your blood I come}
    {Welcomed as Your own}
    {Into the arms of majesty}
    \end
    \verse
    {Behold the bright and risen Son}
    {More beauty than this world has known}
    {I'm face to face with Love Himself}
    {His perfect spotless righteousness}
    {A thousand years, a thousand tongues}
    {Are not enough to sing His praise}
    \end
    \bridge
    {This is the art of celebration}
    {Knowing we're free from condemnation}
    {Oh praise the One, praise the One}
    {Who made an end to all my sin}
    \end
\end{song}
