    {Great, is the Lord and most worthy of praise}
    {The city of our God, the Holy place}
    {The Joy of the whole world.}
    {Great, is the Lord in whom we have the victory}
    {He aids us against the enemy}
    {We bow down on our knees.}
    \end
    \chorus
    {And Lord we want to lift your name on high}
    {And Lord we want to thank you}
    {For the works you've done in our lives}
    {And Lord we trust in Your unfailing love}
    {For you alone are God eternal}
    {Throughout Earth and Heaven, above.}
    \end
