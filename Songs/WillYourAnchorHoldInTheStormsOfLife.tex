\begin{song}{Will Your Anchor Hold In The Storms Of Life}
    \verse
    {Will your anchor hold in the storms of life,}
    {When the clouds unfold their wings of strife?}
    {When the strong tides lift, and the cables strain,}
    {Will your anchor drift or firm remain?}
    \end
    \chorus
    {We have an anchor that keeps the soul}
    {Steadfast and sure while the billows roll,}
    {Fastened to the Rock which cannot move,}
    {Grounded firm and deep in the Saviour's love.}
    \end
    \verse
    {It is safely moored, `twill the storm withstand,}
    {For `tis well secured by the Saviour's hand;}
    {And the cables passed from His heart to mine,}
    {Can defy the blast, through strength divine.}
    \end
    \verse
    {It will firmly hold in the straits of fear,}
    {When the breakers have told the reef is near;}
    {Though the tempest rave and the wild winds blow,}
    {Not an angry wave shall our bark o'erflow.}
    \end
    \verse
    {It will surely hold in the floods of death,}
    {When the waters cold chill our latest breath;}
    {On the rising tide it can never fail,}
    {While our hopes abide within the veil.}
    \end
\end{song}
