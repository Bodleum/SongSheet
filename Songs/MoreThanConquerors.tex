\begin{song}{More Than Conquerors}
    \verse
    {When my hope and strength is gone}
    {You're the one who calls me on}
    {You are the life, You are the fight}
    {That's in my soul}
    \end
    \verse
    {Oh, Your resurrection power}
    {Burns like fire in my heart}
    {When waters rise, I lift my eyes}
    {Up to Your throne}
    \end
    \chorus
    {We are more than conquerors, through Christ}
    {You have overcome this world, this life}
    {We will not bow to sin or to shame}
    {We are defiant in Your name}
    {You are the fire that cannot be tamed}
    {You are the power in our veins}
    {Our Lord, our God, our Conqueror}
    \end
    \verse
    {I will sing into the night}
    {Christ is risen and on high}
    {Greater is He, living in me}
    {Than in the world}
    \end
    \verse
    {No surrender, no retreat}
    {We are free and we're redeemed}
    {We will declare, over despair}
    {You are the hope}
    \end
    \bridge
    {Nothing is impossible}
    {Every chain is breakable}
    {With You, we are victorious}
    {You are stronger than our hearts}
    {You are greater than the dark}
    {With You, we are victorious}
    \end
\end{song}
