\begin{song}{Shout To The North}
    \verse
    {Men of faith rise up and sing}
    {Of the great and glorious King}
    {You are strong when you feel weak}
    {In your brokenness complete}
    \end
    \chorus
    {Shout to the North and the South}
    {Sing to the East and the West}
    {Jesus is Saviour to all}
    {Lord of Heaven and Earth}
    \end
    \verse
    {Rise up women of the truth}
    {Stand and sing to broken hearts}
    {Who can know the healing power}
    {Of our awesome King of love?}
    \end
    \verse
    {We've been through fire, we've been through rain}
    {We've been refined by the power of His name}
    {We've fallen deeper in love with You}
    {You've burned the truth on our lips}
    \end
    \verse
    {Rise up church with broken wings}
    {Fill this place with songs again}
    {Of our God who reigns on high}
    {By His grace again we'll fly}
    \end
