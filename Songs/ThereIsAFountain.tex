\begin{song}{There Is A Fountain}
    \verse
    {There is a fountain filled with blood}
    {Drawn from Immanuel's veins;}
    {And sinners, plunged beneath that flood,}
    {Lose all their guilty stains.}
    \end
    \verse
    {The dying thief rejoiced to see}
    {That fountain in his day;}
    {And there may I, though vile as he,}
    {Wash all my sins away.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Dear dying Lamb, Thy precious blood}
    {Shall never lose its power,}
    {Till all the ransomed ones of God}
    {Be saved, to sin no more.}
    \end
    \verse
    {E'er since by faith I saw the stream}
    {Thy flowing wounds supply,}
    {Redeeming love has been my theme,}
    {And shall be till I die.}
    \end
    \verse
    {When this poor lisping, stammering tongue}
    {Lies silent in the grave,}
    {Then in a nobler, sweeter song,}
    {I'll sing Thy power to save.}
    \end
\end{song}
