\begin{song}{I Heard The Voice Of Jesus Say}
    \verse
    {I \m{C{\sharp}m}heard the voice of \m{E}Jesus \m{B}say,}
    {“Come \m{C{\sharp}m}unto \m{A}Me and \m{B}rest;}
    {Lay \m{C{\sharp}m}down, thou weary \m{E}one, lay \m{B}down}
    {Thy \m{C{\sharp}m}head \m{B}upon My \m{C{\sharp}m}breast.”}
    {I \m{E}came to Jesus \m{B}as I \m{C{\sharp}m}was,}
    {So \m{E}weary, \m{F{\sharp}m}worn and \m{G{\sharp}m}sad;}
    {I \m{C{\sharp}m}found in Him a \m{E}resting \m{B}place,}
    {And \m{G{\sharp}}He has \m{F{\sharp}m}made me \m{C{\sharp}m}glad.}
    \end
    \verse
    {I heard the voice of Jesus say,}
    {“Behold, I freely give}
    {The living water; thirsty one,}
    {Stoop down, and drink, and live.”}
    {I came to Jesus, and I drank}
    {Of that life-giving stream;}
    {My thirst was quenched, my soul revived,}
    {And now I live in Him.}
    \end
    \verse
    {I heard the voice of Jesus say,}
    {“I am this dark world's Light;}
    {Look unto Me, thy morn shall rise,}
    {And all thy day be bright.”}
    {I looked to Jesus, and I found}
    {In Him my Star, my Sun;}
    {And in that light of life I'll walk,}
    {Till trav'ling days are done.}
    \end
    \verse
    {I heard the voice of Jesus say,}
    {“My Father's house above}
    {Has many mansions; I've a place}
    {Prepared for you in love.”}
    {I trust in Jesus—in that house,}
    {According to His word,}
    {Redeemed by grace, my soul shall live}
    {Forever with the Lord.}
    \end
\end{song}
