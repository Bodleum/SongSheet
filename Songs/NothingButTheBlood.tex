\begin{song}{Nothing But The Blood}
    \verse
    {What can wash away my sin?}
    {Nothing but the blood of Jesus;}
    {What can make me whole again?}
    {Nothing but the blood of Jesus.}
    \end
    \chorus
    {Oh, precious is the flow}
    {That makes me white as snow;}
    {No other fount I know,}
    {Nothing but the blood of Jesus.}
    \end
    \verse
    {For my pardon this I see,}
    {Nothing but the blood of Jesus!}
    {For my cleansing this my plea,}
    {Nothing but the blood of Jesus!}
    \end
    \verse
    {Nothing can my sin erase}
    {Nothing but the blood of Jesus!}
    {Naught of works, `tis all of grace,}
    {Nothing but the blood of Jesus!}
    \end
    \verse
    {This is all my hope and peace,}
    {Nothing but the blood of Jesus!}
    {This is all my righteousness,}
    {Nothing but the blood of Jesus!}
    \end
    \verse
    {Now by this I'll overcome,}
    {Nothing but the blood of Jesus!}
    {Now by this I'll reach my home,}
    {Nothing but the blood of Jesus!}
    \end
    \verse
    {Glory! Glory! This I sing,}
    {Nothing but the blood of Jesus!}
    {All my praise for this I bring,}
    {Nothing but the blood of Jesus!}
    \end
