\begin{song}{I Stand Amazed}
    \verse
    {I stand amazed in the presence}
    {Of Jesus the Nazarene}
    {And wonder how He could love me}
    {A sinner, condemned, unclean}
    \end
    \chorus
    {O how marvellous! O how wonderful!}
    {And my song shall ever be:}
    {O how marvellous! O how wonderful!}
    {Is my Saviour's love for me!}
    \end
    \verse
    {He took my sins and my sorrows}
    {He made them His very own;}
    {He bore the burden to Calvary}
    {And suffered and died alone}
    \end
    \verse
    {When with the ransomed in glory}
    {His face I at last shall see}
    {'Twill be my joy through the ages}
    {To sing of His love for me}
    \end
\end{song}
