\begin{song}{Blessed Assurance}
    \verse
    {Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine;}
    {Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine!}
    {Heir of salvation, purchase of God,}
    {Born of His Spirit, washed in His blood.}
    \end
    \chorus
    {This is my story, this is my song,}
    {Praising my Saviour all the day long.}
    {This is my story, this is my song,}
    {Praising my Saviour all the day long.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Perfect submission, perfect delight,}
    {Visions of rapture now burst on my sight;}
    {Angels descending, bring from above}
    {Echoes of mercy, whispers of love.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Perfect submission, all is at rest,}
    {I in my Saviour am happy and blest;}
    {Watching and waiting, looking above,}
    {Filled with His goodness, lost in His love.}
    \end
\end{song}
