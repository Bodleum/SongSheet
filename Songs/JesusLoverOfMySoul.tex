\begin{song}{Jesus, Lover Of My Soul}
    \verse
    {Jesus, lover of my soul,}
    {Let me to Thy bosom fly,}
    {While the nearer waters roll,}
    {While the tempest still is high.}
    {Hide me, O my Saviour, hide,}
    {Till the storm of life is past;}
    {Safe into Heaven guide;}
    {O, receive my soul at last.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Other refuge have I none,}
    {Hangs my helpless soul on Thee;}
    {Leave, ah, leave me not alone,}
    {Still support and comfort me.}
    {All my trust on Thee is stayed,}
    {All my help from Thee I bring;}
    {Cover my defenceless head}
    {With the shadow of Thy wing.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Thou, O Christ, art all I want,}
    {More than all in Thee I find;}
    {Raise the fallen, cheer the faint,}
    {Heal the sick and lead the blind.}
    {Just and holy is Thy name,}
    {Source of all true righteousness;}
    {Thou art evermore the same,}
    {Thou art full of truth and grace.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Plenteous grace with Thee is found,}
    {Grace to cover all my sin;}
    {Let the healing streams abound;}
    {Make and keep me pure within.}
    {Thou of life the fountain art,}
    {Freely let me take of Thee;}
    {Spring Thou up within my heart;}
    {Rise to all eternity.}
    \end
\end{song}
