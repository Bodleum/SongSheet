\begin{song}{Behold Our God}
    \verse
    {Who has held the oceans in His hands?}
    {Who had numbered every grain of sand?}
    {Kings and nations tremble at His voice}
    {All creation rises to rejoice}
    \end
    \chorus
    {Behold our God, seated on His throne}
    {Come let us adore Him}
    {Behold out King, nothing can compare}
    {Come let us adore Him!}
    \end
    \verse
    {Who has given counsel to the Lord?}
    {Who can question any of His words?}
    {Who can teach the One who knows all things?}
    {Who can fathom all His wondrous deeds?}
    \end
    \verse
    {Who has felt the nails upon His hands}
    {Bearing all the guilt of sinful man?}
    {God eternal humbled to the grave}
    {Jesus, Saviour, risen now to reign!}
    \end
\end{song}
