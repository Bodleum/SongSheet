\begin{song}{To God Be The Glory}
    \verse
    {To God be the glory, great things He has done;}
    {So loved He the world that He gave us His Son,}
    {Who yielded His life, an atonement for sin,}
    {And opened the life-gate that all may go in.}
    \end
    \chorus
    {Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!}
    {Let the Earth hear His voice!}
    {Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!}
    {Let the people rejoice!}
    {O come to the Father, through Jesus the Son,}
    {And give Him the glory, great things He has done.}
    \end
    \verse
    {O perfect redemption, the purchase of blood,}
    {To every believer the promise of God;}
    {The vilest offender who truly believes,}
    {That moment from Jesus a pardon receives.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Great things He has taught us, great things He has done}
    {And great our rejoicing through Jesus the Son;}
    {But purer, and higher, and greater will be}
    {Our wonder, our transport, when Jesus we see.}
    \end
\end{song}
