\begin{song}{How Sweet The Name Of Jesus Sounds}
    \verse
    {How sweet the name of Jesus sounds}
    {In a believer's ear!}
    {It soothes his sorrow, heals his wounds,}
    {And drives away his fear.}
    \end
    \verse
    {It makes the wounded spirit whole,}
    {And calms the troubled breast;}
    {'Tis manna to the hungry soul,}
    {And to the weary rest.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Dear Name, the Rock on which we build;}
    {Our shield and hiding-place;}
    {Our never-failing treasury, filled}
    {With boundless stores of grace.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Jesus, our Saviour, Shepherd, Friend,}
    {Our Prophet, Priest, and King;}
    {Our Lord, our Life, our Way, our End,}
    {Accept the praise we bring.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Weak is the effort of our heart,}
    {And cold our warmest thought;}
    {But when we see Thee as Thou art,}
    {We'll praise Thee as we ought.}
    \end
    \verse
    {Till then we would Thy love proclaim}
    {With every fleeting breath;}
    {And triumph in that blessed Name}
    {Which quells the pow'r of death.}
    \end
\end{song}
