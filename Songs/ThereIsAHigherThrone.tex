\begin{song}{There Is A Higher Throne}
    \verse
    {There is a higher throne}
    {Than all this world has known,}
    {Where faithful ones from ev'ry tongue}
    {Will one day come.}
    {Before the Son we'll stand,}
    {Made faultless through the Lamb;}
    {Believing hearts find promised grace-}
    {Salvation comes.}
    \end
    \chorus
    {Hear heaven's voices sing;}
    {Their thund'rous anthem rings}
    {Through em'rald courts and sapphire skies.}
    {Their praises rise.}
    {All glory, wisdom, pow'r,}
    {Strength, thanks, and honour are}
    {To God our King, who reigns on high}
    {For evermore.}
    \end
    \verse
    {And there we'll find our home,}
    {Our life before the throne;}
    {We'll honour Him in perfect song}
    {Where we belong.}
    {He'll wipe each tear-stained eye}
    {As thirst and hunger die.}
    {The Lamb becomes our Shepherd King;}
    {We'll reign with Him.}
    \end
\end{song}
