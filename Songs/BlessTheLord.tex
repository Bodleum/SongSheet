\begin{song}{Bless The Lord}
    \chorus
    {Bless the Lord, O My Soul}
    {O my soul}
    {Worship His holy name}
    {Sing like never before}
    {O my soul}
    {I'll worship Your holy name}
    \end
    \verse
    {The sun comes up, it's a new day dawning}
    {It's time to sing Your song again}
    {Whatever may pass and whatever lies before me}
    {Let me be singing when the evening comes}
    \end
    \verse
    {You're rich in love and You're slow to anger}
    {Your name is great and Your heart is kind}
    {For all Your goodness I will keep on singing}
    {Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find}
    \end
    \verse
    {And on that day when my strength is failing}
    {The end draws near and my time has come}
    {Still my soul will sing Your praise unending}
    {Then thousand years and then for evermore!}
    \end
\end{song}
